Implement a Simple Ping Application – Homework task.
Functionality:
Given some hosts in the config
Example:
• x.com
• y.com

Ping with ICMP protocol
Ping command: ping -n 5 HOST
We should constantly ping these hosts. It should be scheduled with a given delay (the delay should be configured) we do the ping command.
The ping command should be configured, and the HOST is the dynamic part.
If a current ping is still runs for a given host, then we do nothing, another scheduled run will occur. We must store the last icmp ping result for
the given host and when it happened. The result should contain the lines received from command.
The hosts should be checked parallel.
If we have connection timeout during ping or any error (let’s say the pockets sent and received do not match, or the packet loss is not 0) then we
call the Report functionality for the given host (see below).

Ping with TCP/IP protocol
We should constantly ping these addresses. It should be scheduled with a given delay (the delay should be configured) we do HTTP request with
timeout (the timeout should be configured) to the given url. The request can be anything which do the given job. If a current request still runs for a
given URL, then we do nothing, another scheduled run will occur. We must store the last tcp ping result for the given host and when it
happened. This result should contain which url, and how much was the response time (milliseconds) and what was the response http status.
The addresses should be checked parallel.
If we have connection timeout, or host not reachable, or the response time was above a defined value, (the value should be configured) during
ping then we call the Report functionality for the given host (see below).

Trace route
We should constantly trace route these hosts. It should be scheduled, and with a given delay (the delay should be configured) we do a tracert
HOST. The trace command should be configured, and the HOST is the dynamic part. If a current trace route is still runs for a given host, then we
do nothing, another scheduled run will occur. We must store the last trace route result for the given host and when it happened. The result
should contain the lines received from command.
The hosts should be checked parallel.

Report
Calling the report, we have to send data with POST to a given url (the url should be configured) in json format. The POST body should have the
json value.
The data should contain 4 parts for the reporting host: the host, last icmp ping result for the host, last tcp ping result for the host, last trace route
result for the host.
Example structure:

We must log these reports too. The log should go into the local file, and the log should be able to configure. The log level should be warning.
{"host":"the given host", "icmp_ping":"result lines of the last icmp ping command", "tcp_ping":"result lines of
the last tcp ping command", "trace":"result lines of the last trace command"}

The aim
We'd like to check the user connections - status, time to the given host.

Restriction
Java version: 1.8 or higher
Use Threads for parallel jobs.
The program should run on windows or/and on linux. It's not determined but should run at least on one of it.
Maven project
Runnable big jar file with dependency (libs if any) embedded.
Use core java, no frameworks.
Unit tests
